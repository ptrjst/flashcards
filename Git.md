This deck will remind you of all the git goodness you've forgotten.

## Branching and Merging

### Show all local branches

`git branch`

### Show all local and remote branches

`git branch -a` (short for `--all`)

### Show only remote branches

`git branch -r`

### Create a local branch

`git branch name-of-branch`

or if you want to check it out at the same time

`git checkout -b name-of-branch`

### Switch to another branch

`git checkout name-of-branch`
