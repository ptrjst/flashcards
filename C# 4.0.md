## Terms

### Dynamic Typing

A programming language is said to be **dynamically typed** when the majority of its type checking is performed at run-time as opposed to at compile-time. In dynamic typing values have types, but variables do not; that is, a variable can refer to a value of any type. Dynamically typed languages include APL, Erlang, Groovy, JavaScript, Lisp, Lua, MATLAB, GNU Octave, Perl (for user-defined types, but not built-in types), PHP, Pick BASIC, Prolog, Python, R, Ruby, Smalltalk and Tcl.

### Duck Typing

**duck typing** is a style of dynamic typing in which an object's methods and properties determine the valid semantics, rather than its inheritance from a particular class or implementation of a specific interface.

## Syntax

### What is the syntax for defining an optional parameter for a method?

    int Foo(int x, int y = 1)
    {
      return x + y;
    }

### How would you call the method `Foo(int x, int y = 1)` passing the minimum number of required paramters?

    Foo(5);

### How would you call the method `Foo(int x, int y = 1)` overriding the value of the second parameter to be 7?

    Foo(5, 7);
