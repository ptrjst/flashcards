### Everything in Ruby is an ___.

object

Even simple numeric literals and the values true, false, and nil.

### The special value that indicates the absence of a value

`nil`

Ruby's version of null

### Is the Ruby convention to use tabs or spaces?

Spaces. Two spaces per ident.

### Should Ruby have lots of comments?

No. Good Ruby code should speak for itself, and most of the time you should let it do its own talking. 

Good code is like a good joke: It needs no explanation. 

### What is "snake case"?

The `lowercase_words_separated_by_underscores` naming style used for methods, arguments, and variables. 

Class names are the only exception. They're camel case: `MovieTheatre`. 

### What is the naming style for constants?

Ruby programmers seem divided between camel case:

`FurlongsPerFortnight = 0.0001663`

And all uppercase, punctuated by underscore:

`ANTLERS_PER_MALE_MOOSE = 2`

Russ Olsen prefers all uppercase.
