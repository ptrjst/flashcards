# Objects on Rails

### What is the purpose of Object-Oriented software development?

To make our apps easier to change.

Some good habits and sound architectural guidance early on in a project can save a lot of headaches down the road.

### What are the basic principles of Object-Oriented software development?

- Small objects with a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Small methods that do only one thing.
- Limiting the number of types an object collaborates with.
- Strictly limiting the use of global state and singletons (that includes limited the use of class-level methods).
- Small object interfaces with simple method signatures.
- Preferring composition over inheritance.
